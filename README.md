# College-Event-Lister-WebApp
This web application was developed to address a communication gap at Université de Montpellier, where many students were missing out on events organized by the BDE (Bureau des Élèves). The College Event Lister allows planners to easily create and manage events while ensuring that all invited students receive notifications.
